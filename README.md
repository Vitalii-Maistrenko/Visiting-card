# React + Vite

The "Visiting-Card" project is a manifestation of my creative potential and achievements in the field of web development. In this business card, you will find representations of all my projects. Each of these projects is enriched with the use of modern technologies employed in frontend development.

In my business card, you can visually explore examples of my work where HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other frameworks and libraries are utilized. Each project is accompanied not only by a description but also by a technical overview where I disclose the technologies used and approaches to development. Images and demonstrations of interactions with web applications complement this portfolio, providing you with the opportunity to assess the results of my work in action.

May this "Visiting-Card" project be not only informative but also an impressive means of visually expressing my professional growth and competence in frontend development.
